# Contributing

> NOTE: As this project is still in its infancy, we are not accepting pull requests at this time.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
Discord, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change.

## Things to do
- Check out the `good-first-issue` label to start contributing.
- Open an issue before working on something, always mention an issue in your pull request.
- Talk to us! We're always willing to discuss new ideas!

## Things not to do
- Do not host the game somewhere else.
- Do not update the game version, describe your changes and place them in the `unreleasedChangeLogItems`.
- Do not change the `package.json` or `package-lock.json`. Instead, open an issue with why you think that is needed.
- Do not be discouraged if your pull request gets rejected. Sometimes good ideas don't fit in the game at the current time.
